	 * Transforms a value from the original representation to a transformed representation.
	 *
	 * This method is called on two occasions inside a form field:
	 *
	 * 1. When the form field is initialized with the data attached from the datasource (object or array).
	 * 2. When data from a request is submitted using {@link Form::submit()} to transform the new input data
	 *    back into the renderable format. For example if you have a date field and submit '2009-10-10'
	 *    you might accept this value because its easily parsed, but the transformer still writes back
	 *    "2009/10/10" onto the form field (for further displaying or other purposes).
	 *
	 * This method must be able to deal with empty values. Usually this will
	 * be NULL, but depending on your implementation other empty values are
	 * possible as well (such as empty strings). The reasoning behind this is
	 * that value transformers must be chainable. If the transform() method
	 * of the first value transformer outputs NULL, the second value transformer
	 * must be able to process that value.
	 *
	 * By convention, transform() should return an empty string if NULL is
	 * passed.
	 *
	 * @param mixed $value The value in the original representation
	 *
	 * @return mixed The value in the transformed representation
	 *
	 * @throws TransformationFailedException When the transformation fails.
